### **Deploying Solutions from Google Cloud Marketplace Using Both Console and Cloud Shell**

Google Cloud Marketplace allows you to deploy solutions using either the Google Cloud Console or Cloud Shell. Below are the steps to deploy solutions using both methods:

### **Using Google Cloud Console**

#### **1. Deploying WordPress**
- **Step 1: Navigate to Google Cloud Marketplace**
  - In the Google Cloud Console, click the hamburger menu (☰) and select “Marketplace.”
  
- **Step 2: Search and Select WordPress**
  - In the Marketplace search bar, type "WordPress" and select the WordPress solution.
  
- **Step 3: Configure the Deployment**
  - Click on "Launch" to open the deployment configuration.
  - Select the project, region, machine type, and boot disk size.
  - Set network settings, allowing HTTP and HTTPS traffic.
  
- **Step 4: Deploy the Application**
  - Click "Deploy" to start the WordPress deployment.
  
- **Step 5: Access WordPress**
  - After the deployment is complete, you’ll receive the site URL and login credentials to manage your WordPress site.

#### **2. Deploying MySQL Database**
- **Step 1: Search for MySQL in Marketplace**
  - In the Marketplace, search for "MySQL" and select it.
  
- **Step 2: Configure MySQL**
  - Click "Launch" and configure the database settings, such as region, machine type, and disk size.
  - Set the root password and configure network settings.
  
- **Step 3: Deploy MySQL**
  - Click "Deploy" to create the MySQL database instance.
  
- **Step 4: Integrate with WordPress**
  - Configure WordPress to connect to the MySQL database by entering the database credentials during WordPress setup.

### **Using Google Cloud Shell**

#### **1. Deploying WordPress**
- **Step 1: Open Cloud Shell**
  - Click the Cloud Shell icon in the Google Cloud Console to open a terminal.

- **Step 2: Deploy WordPress via Cloud Shell**
  - Use the following `gcloud` command to deploy WordPress:
    ```bash
    gcloud deployment-manager deployments create wordpress-deployment --config https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/deploymentmanager-samples/master/dm/marketplace/wordpress/v2/wordpress.jinja
    ```
  - This command uses Deployment Manager to deploy WordPress based on a pre-configured template.

- **Step 3: Verify Deployment**
  - Once the deployment is complete, use the Cloud Shell to list your deployments and find the WordPress URL:
    ```bash
    gcloud deployment-manager deployments describe wordpress-deployment
    ```

#### **2. Deploying MySQL Database**
- **Step 1: Deploy MySQL via Cloud Shell**
  - Use the following `gcloud` command to deploy a MySQL instance:
    ```bash
    gcloud sql instances create mysql-instance --tier=db-n1-standard-1 --region=us-central1
    ```
  - Replace `mysql-instance` with your preferred instance name.

- **Step 2: Set MySQL Root Password**
  - Set the root password for MySQL:
    ```bash
    gcloud sql users set-password root --host=% --instance=mysql-instance --password=YOUR_PASSWORD
    ```

- **Step 3: Integrate with WordPress**
  - Use the Cloud Shell to configure your WordPress instance to connect to the MySQL database by editing the WordPress configuration file:
    ```bash
    nano /var/www/html/wp-config.php
    ```
  - Add the MySQL connection details in the configuration file.

### **Integrated Solution Example Using Both Console and Cloud Shell**

To create an integrated system combining WordPress, MySQL, and a load balancer:

1. **Deploy WordPress (Console)**: Use the Google Cloud Console to deploy the WordPress application as described above.
2. **Deploy MySQL (Cloud Shell)**: Use Cloud Shell to create the MySQL instance and configure it to work with WordPress.
3. **Deploy Load Balancer (Console)**: Use the Console to set up an NGINX load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple WordPress instances.

### **Summary**

Using both the Google Cloud Console and Cloud Shell provides flexibility in deploying and managing solutions from the Google Cloud Marketplace. The Console offers a user-friendly interface, while Cloud Shell provides a powerful command-line environment for more advanced configurations and automation. By combining these tools, you can efficiently deploy integrated systems tailored to your specific needs.
