### **Step 5: Get $300 Free Credit**
1. Once you’ve completed the sign-up process, you’ll be **automatically enrolled in the free trial** with $300 of credits.
2. The **trial lasts 90 days**, or until you spend the $300 in credits, whichever comes first.

   - During this time, you can use most of Google Cloud’s services, including Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, BigQuery, and more.
   - **No automatic charges** will occur after the trial ends, and you can choose to upgrade your account to continue using the services.

### **Step 6: Explore Google Cloud Platform**
1. After signing up, you’ll be redirected to the **Google Cloud Console** where you can start exploring and creating resources.
   
   - You can **set up projects**, create **virtual machines**, configure **storage buckets**, and more using your free credits.

### **Important Notes about the Free Trial**:
- **$300 in free credits**: These credits can be used for any Google Cloud service.
- **No automatic billing**: After your trial ends, your account will stop using the resources unless you choose to upgrade to a paid plan.
- **Trial duration**: The free trial lasts for 90 days or until the $300 credits are exhausted, whichever comes first.
- **No auto-renewal**: Once your credits or trial period ends, services are paused unless you opt-in to upgrade.

### **Summary**
You now have a Google Cloud account with $300 in free credits to explore and use various Google Cloud services. You won’t be charged unless you choose to upgrade your account to a paid plan. Take this opportunity to experiment with Google Cloud’s tools like Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, and BigQuery.
